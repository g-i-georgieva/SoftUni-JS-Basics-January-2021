The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills required for all of the technological majors at the University of Software. This includes basic coding skills, working with development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, console handling (reading input and output printing), using the conditional constructions (if, if-else) and cycles (for, while, do-while). The course ends with a practical programming exam, which is accepted in the software engineering program of the Software University.
